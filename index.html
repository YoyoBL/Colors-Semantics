            <h2>I Tested Every Colored Pencil to Find the BEST ONE!</h2>
            <p>
               This article is currently under construction while my team and I
               gather all the information we have collected and build it into a
               format that’s easy for you to read! We’ll be including the
               results of every pencil for every test over the next few weeks.
               For now, you can watch the video below to see the summary, and
               find all of the tested brands with links to purchase below. If
               you’d like to be notified by email when everything is updated,
               you can join my email newsletter, and you’ll also get a free
               coloring book.

            <h2>Ultimate White Pen Shopping Guide</h2>
            <p>
               If you caught Part One of this series, you know that I’ve I spent
               countless hours testing and re-testing as many white pens as I
               can find to bring you the ultimate best white pen. I took 61
               white gel pens, white paint pens and white inks and tested them
               on black paper, over pencils and markers and so much more,
               eliminating a few pens at each round until we reached what I
               believe were the final few, best quality pens.

            <p>
               On the 26th Feb 2021, I posted a video announcing my goal to
               reach 100k subscribers on my YouTube channel by the end of the
               year. This week, we finally passed the huge goal of 100,000
               subscribers on this YouTube channel! I want to extend a HUGE
               thank you to every single one of you who has supported my channel
               and helped me get here!
            </p>
